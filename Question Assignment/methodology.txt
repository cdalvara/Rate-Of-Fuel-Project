The development methodology that our group is going to use is the incremental development.
We decided to use this methodology because the requirements of this project are clearly explained and understood.
In addition, since we are in a shorter semester, we are applying incremental development because it is used when there is a tight deadline or deadlines.
One of the characteristics of this methodology is that a project or software is split into different stages,
which is what we are going to do in this class: first the front end, second the back end, third the database, and finally creating the pricing module.
In the first stage, we will create the user interface in which the user will be able to register, login, manage their profile, and fill out a fuel quote form.
During the second stage we will create the back end in which we will receive the data from the user interface, validate it, and prepare to connect it to a database.
In the third stage, our group is going to create a database with the given requirements.
Lastly, during the final stage our group will create a pricing module that should be able to calculate the price per gallon based on the given formula.
We will be using asp.net with C# to create our web application.

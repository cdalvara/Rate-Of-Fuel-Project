1. Outside of using asp.net, since we need to make a website app, it's important that we create an interface that the customer can easily navigate and login. 
This will probably take the form of a simple login screen when the website is accessed. If their username is not detected, they will be given the option to register. 
There also will be a link underneath the login that leads to registration as well. 
So that previous users can access their old accounts, we'll store the username and password in an SQL database together with the rest of the profile info and quote history.
To access, there will likely be a binary search initially, and then the result will be indexed in a hash table for easy future access.
Afterwards, they can go ahead to edit their personal information/profile. When they want to get a quote, they'll access a fuel quote form in which all the info about fuel that the they needs can be filled out. This will make up the front end.
The back end will have things that the user does not need to see, but is necessary to keep tabs on the user, and correctly calculate their fuel quote. 
This will draw from the database we create, as well as be populated by the login screen.
Lastly, the database holds all this information, and we'll have a way for the backend to pull up information (likely by using a hash index), in order to make the necessary calculations. 
We'll use Microsoft SQL Server to create the database, as it pairs well with asp.net.
